# YYC Show Map

An open-source aggregator of Calgary concert information! Focused on live music, but all shows welcome.

Not affiliated with any venues or ticketing platforms, just sharing a tool I made for personal use to track shows in Calgary.

Feel free to fork for your city!

Sorry if some events are duplicated. This is a quick and nasty tool, I don't want to spend too much time to de-duplicate events, my attitude is "better double than missing". 

PRs always welcome <3
